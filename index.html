  					<h1>Personal Information</h1>

  				<div class="sectionContent">
  					<p>My name is Keaton Ferber, I live in a small town in rural SA. I graduated Year 12 in 2014 and have previously worked as a cellar hand at a local winery for many years. My main hobby is playing video games, its something I’ve enjoyed since I was very young. I also enjoy watching movies, TV and anime. I’m a huge Star Wars fan and my favourite movie they have released is Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith. My friend got me into watching F1 in 2020 and I’ve been following avidly since. I root for Ferrari and my favourite driver is Charles Leclerc. I love cats and have a cat named Ezra; he keeps me company.  </p>

  					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  				</div>

  				<div class="sectionContent">
  					<p>My interest in IT started at a young age. My interest with technology started with playing video games on our PlayStation 2, but I also spent a lot of time on our family desktop computer.  I’ve always found computers fascinating and enjoyed tinkering with them. For my research project in high school, I built my own desktop computer. I really enjoyed the process and still build and upgrade my PCs to this day.  I chose to study at RMIT as I was looking to Study IT through Open Universities Australia (OUA), and RMIT was recommended.  I expect to learn the skills required for my chosen career. </p>

    				<h1>Ideal Job</h1>

    				<article>
    					<h2>Game Developer</h2>


    					<p>Right now, I’m not one hundred percent certain what my ideal job will be. A potential ideal job is a game developer. More specially a programmer for games development. A job as a game developer is appealing as I’ve been playing games for a long time, and it is something I’m passionate about. I think I would really enjoy being a developer creating my own games and experiences. </p>

    					<p>As shown in the job listing above Higher education is required in a related degree such as Software Engineering, Computer Science etc.  The main skill required for this is to have good programming skills with C++. The job also requires experience with Unreal game development.  </p>

    					<p>Currently I do not have any skills relative to this job as I have only just started my degree. </p>

    					<p>I plan to get the skills for this job by completing my degree. I plan on choosing electives focused on programming and game development. I also would look doing an internship at a game development studio to get vital experience and make connections. </p>

        					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
        					<p>I personally do not put a lot of weight into only personality tests.  There are however some things you can draw from them.  As seen in the image above the test determined I was a turbulent adventurer, code ISFP-T. I already knew I was a highly introverted person, and this test also shows that. The test also shows I am highly observant and turbulent. From the results above in the team I believe I will not be a leading figure, rather a more supporting and follower role.  When forming a team, I think it will be important that I join a team with people that are more outgoing and have leadership qualities.  </p>

        					<h2>Learning Style Test</h2>
                  <p><img src="Figure3.jpg" alt="Figure3" /></p>
        					<p>As seen in my learning style test results I had a relatively even split of learning style with a slight bias towards visual learner, and a slight bias against tactile learner.  This means I should focus on auditory and visual forms of learning as they make up the majority of the way I learn best. </p>

        					<h2>Big 5 Personality Test</h2>
                  <p><img src="Figure4.jpg" alt="Figure4" width=540 /></p>
        					<p>As seen in chart above I scored highly for Neuroticism and Agreeableness. I scored low on extraversion, and on the lower end Openness to experience and Conscientiousness. Scoring low on openness means I prefer my practical and conventional methods. Scoring high on agreeableness means that I will work well in a team as this points to being a helpful and trusting person. In common with the 16 personalities test it shows I am a very introverted person. Knowing this when forming a team, I think I should look to join people with at least one person that scores highly in openness. Pairing with a more imaginative and open person will complement my structured approach to use the best of both.  I also think again I should look to join an extroverted person that can do more a leading role in the team. </p>

            				<h1>My IT Project Idea</h1>
            			</div>

            			<div class="sectionContent">
            				<article>
            					<h2>Overview</h2>
            					<p>My IT project is to develop virtual reality game. The game is a physics-based melee combat game set in a medieval time with phantasy elements.  The game will primarily focus on online one on one PVP. The game will be developed using Unity. Unity is a cross platform game engine and has an XR interaction toolkit that can be used to create the VR elements of the game. The networking of the game will be done using Photon networking with Unity. </p>
            				</article>

            				<article>
            					<h2>Motivation</h2>
            					<p>VR as a gaming platform is growing every year (Smith 2021). It is an immersive way to play video games and has many unique experiences. VR is the perfect medium for a melee combat based game. There are many melee combat focused VR video games out, but none of them have online multiplayer. This project aims to create an online PVP melee combat focused game to fill the void in the market. </p>
            				</article>

            				<article>
            					<h2>Description</h2>
            					<p>The game is set in a medieval time with phantasy elements. This means the game will be using traditional medieval weapons and locations. Such weaponry will include swords, shields, axes, rapiers and many more similar weapons. Combat will take place in various medieval themed arenas.  The phantasy elements of the game are in the form of spells and sorceries. </p>

                      <p>The game is to be played in virtual reality. This means the game will require a VR headset. The game is room scale VR which means it will use six depth of field tracking and the player will physically move around the world created. They will interact with every object in game using controllers that replicated inputs from hands. </p>

                      <p>The games combat will be based on physics-based interactions. The player will use the weapons by using VR controllers to simulate hands. They will be able to move their hand and squeeze on the trigger to grab items. This means they can grab a weapon and swing it themselves with their hands.  They will also be able to grab and use a shield to block. Players can also use their hands to wield ranged weapons, such as a bow which requires two hands to use. Spells will be able to be selected using the controllers, and cast using movements of the hands. </p>

                      <p>Players control movement in game with a combination of the analogue stick as well as moving physically themselves. When the player is stationary, they can move the left analogue stick to move around and control the direction they are facing with the right analogue stick. The player can also use the tracking inherent with VR to move themselves within the area they have available. They allow for the player to physically dodge attacks and maneuverer during combat.</p>

                      <p>The interactions between players and objects are to be simulated as close to life as possible. This means heavy weapons cannot be used effectively with one hand and will require two hands. Weapons have real weight and cannot be swung as fast as a hand can move in the real life. Objects can be thrown and will follow a realistic trajectory.  The interactions between players clashing swords, hitting each other to deal damage will make up the bread and butter of gameplay. </p>

                      <p>There will be a sandbox training mode, where the player can practice using the various weapons and sorceries at their disposal. The sole game mode will be one verses one online. In this game mode it is a simple one verse one fight between two players to the death. It will be a best of three system, where the first person to win three rounds wins. There will be online matchmaking as well as private lobbies. The two online playlists will be a casual mode and a ranked multiplayer mode. </p>
            				</article>

            				<article>
            					<h2>Skills and Tools Required</h2>
            					<p>The first skill required will be the ability to make games using Unity.  This means creating all the assets and scenes as well as all the gameplay elements. When creating a VR game in unity, you need to add the XR interaction tool kit. This toolkit is used to enable VR features such as head tracking and controller tracking. While using Unity to create a game, I need to be able to write scripts. </p>

                      <p>To setup the multiplayer aspects of this game I will need to learn how to use photon servers in conjunction with Unity. I can use Unity’s Visual Scripting tool but learning to code in C# is ideal. To test this VR game, a VR headset is required.</p>

                      <p>Preferably I would have access to all the popular VR headsets to test the game on each platform. For the multiplayer aspects at least one other individual will need to have access to VR headsets to test the online multiplayer with me. </p>
                  </article>

            				<article>
            					<h2>Outcome</h2>
            					<p>The outcome of this project would be a completed online PVP VR melee combat game. The game will have working melee combat. It will closely simulate real life combat with the weapons in the game. The game will have functional online multiplayer. When completed and put on the market, it will fill the void in the VR games industry of their being no PVP VR melee combat games. </p>
